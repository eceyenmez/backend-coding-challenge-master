# backend-coding-challenge-master

* My first Kotlin project.
* Used Kotlin parts mostly as is with little additions for the second task.
* Tried to implement a clean structure with single responsibility.
* To have a clean controller layer, created custom exceptions and custom exception handler.
* Logged crutial exceptions to monitor later by creating alerts.
* Tried to add Swagger for documentation but did not work for now. 
* Next step is to increase documentation by using OpenAPI3.
